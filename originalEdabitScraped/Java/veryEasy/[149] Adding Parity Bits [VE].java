####  Adding Parity Bits  ####

Parity bits are used as a very simple checksum to ensure that binary data isn't corrupted during transit. Here's how they work:
___
*) If a binary string has an odd number of 1's, the parity bit is a 1.
*) If a binary string has an even number of 1's, the parity bit is a 0.
*) The parity bit is appended to the end of the binary string.
___

Create a function that adds the correct parity bit to a binary string.


[Examples]

___
addParityBit("1011011") ➞ "10110111"

// There are five 1's.
// Since five is odd, the parity bit should be a 1.
// Add the parity bit to the end of the string.
// Return the result.

addParityBit("0110000") ➞ "01100000"

addParityBit("0101101") ➞ "01011010"

addParityBit("1111111") ➞ "11111111"
_____



[Notes]

All inputs will be 7-bits long (so that the parity bit makes it a full byte).
