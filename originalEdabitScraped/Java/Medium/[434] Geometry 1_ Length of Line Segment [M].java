####  Geometry 1: Length of Line Segment  ####

Write a function that takes coordinates of two points on a two-dimensional plane and returns the length of the line segment connecting those two points.


[Examples]

___
lineLength(arr[0]={15, 7}, arr[1]={22, 11}) ➞ 8.06

lineLength(arr[0]={0, 0}, arr[1]={0, 0}) ➞ 0

lineLength(arr[0]={0, 0}, arr[1]={1, 1}) ➞ 1.41
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The numbers in the argument array can be positive or negative.
*) The order of the given numbers is X, Y.
*) There is 0.1 tolerance so you don't need to round your result.
*) This challenge is easier than it looks.
