####  Automorphic Numbers  ####

A number n is automorphic if n^2 ends in n.
For example: n=5, n^2=25
Create a function that takes a number and returns true if the number is automorphic, false if it isn't.


[Examples]

___
isAutomorphic(5) ➞ true

isAutomorphic(8) ➞ false

isAutomorphic(76) ➞ true
_____



[Notes]

Squaring numbers can make them get quite large.
