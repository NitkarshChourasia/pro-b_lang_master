####  Unmix My Strings  ####

lPaeesh le pemu mnxit ehess rtnisg! Oh, sorry, that was supposed to say: Please help me unmix these strings!
Somehow my strings have all become mixed up; every pair of characters has been swapped. Help me undo this so I can understand my strings again.


[Examples]

___
unmix("123456") ➞ "214365"

unmix("hTsii  s aimex dpus rtni.g") ➞ "This is a mixed up string."

unmix("badce") ➞ "abcde"
_____



[Notes]

The length of a string can be odd — in this case the last character is not altered (as there's nothing to swap it with).
