####  Integral of a Function  ####

Create a function that takes numbers b, m, and n as arguments and returns the definite integral of the function f(x)=(b+1)*x^b with respect to x from x=m to x=n, where b, m, and n are constants.


[Examples]

___
Integral(0, 2, 5) ➞ 3

Integral(2, 4, 7) ➞ 279

Integral(5, 9, 3) ➞ -530712
_____



[Notes]

___
*) ^ in the context of this challenge means "to the power of", also known as the "exponent" operator.
*) Assume that b will be an integer greater than or equal to 0.
*) m and n can be any integer, both positive and negative.
