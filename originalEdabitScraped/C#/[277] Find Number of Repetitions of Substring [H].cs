####  Find Number of Repetitions of Substring  ####

Create a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the number of repitions of a substring. This the opposite of creating a string by repeating a smaller string n times. For example "abc" repeated4 times would be "abcabcabcabc"
In this challenge, we do the opposite. Given the final string, and ask the number of times the substring is repeated.


[Examples]

___
NumberOfRepeats("abcabcabcabc" ) ➞ 4

NumberOfRepeats("bcbcbc") ➞ 3

NumberOfRepeats("llbllbllbllbllbllb") ➞ 6

NumberOfRepeats("kc") ➞ 1
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Assume that the substring length is always greater than 1.
*) Assume that the string length is always greater than 1.
*) Assume that the substring is not always the same.
___
