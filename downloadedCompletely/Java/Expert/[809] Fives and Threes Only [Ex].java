####  Fives and Threes Only  ####

Write a function that mimics the following described arithmetic operations.
Starting with either 3 or 5 and given these operations:
___
*) add 5
*) multiply by 3
___

You should say if it is possible to reach the target number n.


[Examples]

___
only5and3(14) ➞ true
// 14 = 3*3 + 5

only5and3(25) ➞ true
// 25 = 5+5+5+5+5

only5and3(7) ➞ false
// There exists no path to the target number 7
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Only addition and multiplication arithmetic operations are allowed.
*) You can solve this problem recursively or algebraically.
