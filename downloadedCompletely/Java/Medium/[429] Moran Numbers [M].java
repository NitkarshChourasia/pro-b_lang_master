####  Moran Numbers  ####

A Harshad number is a number which is divisible by the sum of its digits. For example, 132 is divisible by 6 (1+3+2).
A subset of the Harshad numbers are the Moran numbers. Moran numbers yield a prime when divided by the sum of their digits. For example, 133 divided by 7 (1+3+3) yields 19, a prime.
Create a function that takes a number and returns "M" if the number is a Moran number, "H" if it is a (non-Moran) Harshad number, or "Neither".


[Examples]

___
moran(132) ➞ "H"

moran(133) ➞ "M"

moran(134) ➞ "Neither"
