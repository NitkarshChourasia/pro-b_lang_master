####  Pronic Number  ####

A pronic number (or otherwise called as heteromecic) is a number which is a product of two consecutive integers, that is, a number of the form n(n + 1). Create a function that determines whether a number is pronic or not.


[Examples]

___
isHeteromecic(0) ➞ true
// 0 * (0 + 1) = 0 * 1 = 0

isHeteromecic(2) ➞ true
// 1 * (1 + 1) = 1 * 2 = 2

isHeteromecic(7) ➞ false

isHeteromecic(110) ➞ true
// 10 * (10 + 1) = 10 * 11 = 110

isHeteromecic(136) ➞ false

isHeteromecic(156) ➞ true
