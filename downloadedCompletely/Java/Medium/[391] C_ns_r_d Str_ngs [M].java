####  C*ns*r*d Str*ngs  ####

Someone has attempted to censor my strings by replacing every vowel with a *, l*k* th*s. Luckily, I've been able to find the vowels that were removed.
Given a censored string and a string of the censored vowels, return the original uncensored string.


[Example]

___
uncensor("Wh*r* d*d my v*w*ls g*?", "eeioeo") ➞ "Where did my vowels go?"

uncensor("abcd", "") ➞ "abcd"

uncensor("*PP*RC*S*", "UEAE") ➞ "UPPERCASE"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The vowels are given in the correct order.
*) The number of vowels will match the number of * characters in the censored string.
