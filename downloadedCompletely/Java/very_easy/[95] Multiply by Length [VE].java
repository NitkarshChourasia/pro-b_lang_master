####  Multiply by Length  ####

Create a function to multiply all of the values in an array by the amount of values in the given array.


[Examples]

___
MultiplyByLength([2, 3, 1, 0]) ➞ [8, 12, 4, 0]

MultiplyByLength([4, 1, 1]) ➞ ([12, 3, 3])

MultiplyByLength([1, 0, 3, 3, 7, 2, 1]) ➞  [7, 0, 21, 21, 49, 14, 7]

MultiplyByLength([0]) ➞ ([0])
