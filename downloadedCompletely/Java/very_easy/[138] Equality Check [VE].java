####  Equality Check  ####

In this challenge, you must verify the equality of two different values given the parameters a and b.
Both the value and type of the parameters need to be equal. The possible types of the given parameters are:
___
*) Numbers
*) Strings
*) Booleans (false or true)
*) Special values: null
___

What have you learned so far that will permit you to do two different checks (value and type) with a single statement?
Implement a function that returns true if the parameters are equal, and false if they are not.


[Examples]

___
checkEquality(1, true) ➞ false
// A number and a boolean: the value and type are different.

checkEquality(0, "0") ➞ false
// A number and a string: the type is different.

checkEquality(1,  1) ➞ true
// A number and a number: the type and value are equal.
