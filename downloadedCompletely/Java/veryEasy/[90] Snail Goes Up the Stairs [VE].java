####  Snail Goes Up the Stairs  ####

A snail goes up the stairs. Every step, he must go up (distance = height of step), then go to the next step (distance = length of step). He wants to reach the top of the tower (tower height = tower).
Write a function that returns the distance the snail must travel to the top of the tower.


[Examples]

___
TotalDistance(0.2, 0.4, 100.0) ➞ 300.0
// Total distance is 300.

TotalDistance(0.3, 0.2, 25.0) ➞ 41.7

TotalDistance(0.1, 0.1, 6.0) ➞ 12
_____



[Notes]

___
*) All given values are greater than 0.
*) Tolerance of returned value is 0.1.
*) Number of steps determined by tower height divided by stair height.
*) For the purposes of this exercise, the last step's length must be counted to complete the journey.
