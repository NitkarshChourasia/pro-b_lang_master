Create a function that takes three arguments prob, prize, pay and returns true if prob * prize > pay; otherwise return false.

profitableGamble(0.2, 50, 9) ➞ true

profitableGamble(0.9, 1, 2) ➞ false

A profitable gamble is a game that yields a positive net profit, where net profit is calculated in the following manner: net_outcome = probability_of_winning * prize - cost_of_playing.
