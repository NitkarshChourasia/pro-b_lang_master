####  Radian to Degree  ####

Create a function that takes an angle in radians and converts it into degrees.


[Examples]

___
toDegree(Math.PI) ➞ 180.0

toDegree(Math.PI/2) ➞ 90.0

toDegree(Math.PI/4) ➞ 45.0
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The input angles are in radians.
*) You will need to decide the data types for the input and output of the function.
*) Check out the Resources tab.
*) There are 360 degrees and 2 pi radians in a circle. So to convert degrees to radians, divide by 360 and multiply by 2 * pi (approx. 6.28). Or equivalently, divide by 180 and multiply by pi.
*) Try not to use the built-in method Math.toDegrees().
