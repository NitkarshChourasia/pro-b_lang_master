####  The Collatz Conjecture  ####

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:
___
*) If n is even -> n / 2
*) If n is odd -> n * 3 + 1
___

Create a function to repeatedly evaluate these operations, until reaching 1. Return the number of steps it took.
See the following example, using 10 as the input, with 6 steps:



[Examples]

___
collatzConjecture(2) ➞ 1

collatzConjecture(3) ➞ 7

collatzConjecture(10) ➞ 6
_____

A New Approach on Proving Collatz Conjecture
https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jmath/2019/6129836/
Collatz Conjecture (3x+1 problem) states any natural number x will return to 1 after 3x+1 computation (when x is odd) and x/2 computation (when x is even).
