####  Backspace Attack  ####

[Examples]

___

erase("major# spar##ks") ➞ "majo spks"

erase("si###t boy") ➞ "t boy"

erase("####") ➞ ""

[Notes]

___
*) In addition to characters, backspaces can also remove whitespaces.
*) If the number of hashes exceeds the previous characters, remove those previous characters entirely (see example #3).
*) If there only exist backspaces, return an empty string (see example #4).
