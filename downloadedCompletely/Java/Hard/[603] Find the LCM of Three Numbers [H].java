####  Find the LCM of Three Numbers  ####

Create a function that takes an array of three numbers and returns the Least Common Multiple (LCM).
The LCM is the smallest positive number that is a multiple of two or more numbers. In our case, we are dealing with three numbers.
___
*) Multiples of 3 are: 3, 6, 9, 12, and so on.
*) Multiples of 4 are: 4, 8,12, and so on.
*) Multiples of 12 are: 12, 24, 36, and so on.
___

Thus, the least common multiple of 3, 4, and 12 is 12.


[Examples]

___
lcmThree([9, 18, 27]) ➞ 54

lcmThree([23, 46, 2]) ➞ 46

lcmThree([5, 7, 13]) ➞ 455

lcmThree([104, 105, 107]) ➞ 1168440

lcmThree([19, 47, 43]) ➞ 38399
