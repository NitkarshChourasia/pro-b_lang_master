####  Javelin Parabolic Throw  ####

Write a function that takes initial speed (v in m/s) and throw angle (a in degrees) and returns the maximum height and maximum range reached by javelin as a string.


[Examples]

___
javelinThrow(36.7, 45) ➞ "Ymax=34m, Xmax=137m"

javelinThrow(51.3, 20) ➞ "Ymax=16m, Xmax=172m"

javelinThrow(100.1, 89) ➞ "Ymax=511m, Xmax=36m"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Javelin starts moving at h=0m.
*) Gravitational acceleration is g=9.81 m/s^2.
*) All results should be rounded to the nearest whole number.
*) You can find all mathematical equations in Resources.
*) Remember that Math.sin() and Math.cos() methods don't take degree as an argument.
