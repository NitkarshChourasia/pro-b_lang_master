####  Wrong Number  ####

Tesha needs your help to find out a wrong number in a 2D array.
Imagine a 2D array of numbers given below:
___
var arr = [
  [1, 2, 3, 6 ],
  [4, 5, 6, 15],
  [7, 8, 9, 24],
  [12,15,18,45]
]
_____

You can notice that:
___
*) The end number of each row is the sum of each row's previous numbers.
*) The end number of each column is the sum of each column's previous numbers.
___

See below examples for a better understanding:
___
arr1 = [
  [2, 2, 3, 6 ],
  [4, 5, 6, 15],
  [7, 8, 9, 24],
  [12,15,18,45]
]

// 2 is incorrect in the first row and first column.
// Replace it with 1.

arr2 = [
  [1, 2, 3, 7 ],
  [4, 5, 6, 15],
  [7, 8, 9, 24],
  [12,15,18,45]
]

// 7 is incorrect in the first row and fourth column.
// Replace it with 6.

arr3 = [
  [1, 2, 3, 6 ],
  [4, 5, 6, 15],
  [7, 8, 9, 24],
  [12,15,18,46]
]

// 46 is incorrect in the fourth row and fourth column.
// Replace it with 45.
