####  Combined Consecutive Sequence  ####

Write a function that returns true if two arrays, when combined, form a consecutive sequence. A consecutive sequence is a sequence without any gaps in the integers, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is a consecutive sequence, but 1, 2, 4, 5 is not.


[Examples]

___
consecutiveCombo([12, 13, 17, 19], [14, 16, 15, 18]) ➞ true

consecutiveCombo([7, 4, 5, 1], [2, 3, 6]) ➞ true

consecutiveCombo([1, 4, 6, 5], [2, 7, 8, 9]) ➞ false

consecutiveCombo([1, 4, 5, 6], [2, 3, 7, 8, 10]) ➞ false

consecutiveCombo([44, 46], [45]) ➞ true
