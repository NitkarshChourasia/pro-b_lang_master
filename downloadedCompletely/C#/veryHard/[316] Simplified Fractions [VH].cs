####  Simplified Fractions  ####

Create a function that returns the simplified version of a fraction.


[Examples]

___
Simplify("4/6") ➞ "2/3"

Simplify("10/11") ➞ "10/11"

Simplify("100/400") ➞ "1/4"

Simplify("8/4") ➞ "2"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) A fraction is simplified if there are no common factors (except 1) between the numerator and the denominator. For example, 4/6 is not simplified, since 4 and 6 both share 2 as a factor.
*) If improper fractions can be transformed into integers, do so in your code (see example #4).
