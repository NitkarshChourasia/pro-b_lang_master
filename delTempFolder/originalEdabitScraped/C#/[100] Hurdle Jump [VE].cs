####  Hurdle Jump  ####

Create a function that takes an array of hurdle heights and a jumper's jump height, and determine whether or not the hurdler can clear all the hurdles.
A hurdler can clear a hurdle if their jump height is greater than or equal to the hurdle height.


[Examples]

___
hurdleJump([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) ➞ true

hurdleJump([5, 5, 3, 4, 5], 3) ➞ false

hurdleJump([5, 4, 5, 6], 10) ➞ true

hurdleJump([1, 2, 1], 1) ➞ false
_____



[Notes]

Return true for the edge case of an empty array of hurdles. (Zero hurdles means that any jump height can clear them).
