####  An Introduction to the Map-Reduce Pattern  ####

You will be implementing a basic case of the map-reduce pattern in programming. Given a vector stored as an array of numbers, find the magnitude of the vector. Use the standard distance formula for n-dimensional Cartesian coordinates.


[Examples]

___
Magnitude([3, 4]) ➞ 5

Magnitude([0, 0, -10]) ➞ 10

Magnitude([]) ➞ 0

Magnitude([2, 3, 6, 1, 8] ) ➞ 10.677078252031311
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The array can have any length.
*) The input array will contain integers (except for empty array [] ➞ 0).
*) Write your own .map() and .reduce() methods in your solution or use these queries through LINQ (don't forget to connect the library System.Linq).
