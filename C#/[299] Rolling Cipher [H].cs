####  Rolling Cipher  ####

Write a function that accepts a string and an n and returns a cipher by rolling each character forward (n > 0) or backward (n < 0) n times.
Note: Think of the letters as a connected loop, so rolling a backwards once will yield z, and rolling z forward once will yield a. If you roll 26 times in either direction, you should end up back where you started.


[Examples]

___
RollingCipher("abcd", 1) ➞ "bcde"

RollingCipher("abcd", -1) ➞ "zabc"

RollingCipher("abcd", 3) ➞ "defg"

RollingCipher("abcd", 26) ➞ "abcd"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) All letters are lower cased.
*) No spacing.
*) Each character is rotated the same number of times.
