####  Add up the Numbers from a Single Number  ####

Create a function that takes a number as an argument. Add up all the numbers from 1 to the number you passed to the function. For example, if the input is 4 then your function should return 10 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.


[Examples]

___
AddUp(4) ➞ 10

AddUp(13) ➞ 91

AddUp(600) ➞ 180300
_____



[Notes]

Expect any positive number between 1 and 1000.
