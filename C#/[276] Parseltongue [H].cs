####  Parseltongue  ####

Hermione has come up with a precise formula for determining whether or not a phrase was ssspoken by a parssseltongue (a reference from the Harry Potter universe; the language of ssserpents and those who can converse with them).
Each word in a sssentence must contain either:



[Examples]

___
IsParselTongue("Sshe ssselects to eat that apple. ") ➞ true

IsParselTongue("She ssselects to eat that apple. ") ➞ false
// "She" only contains one "s".

IsParselTongue("Beatrice samples lemonade") ➞ false
// While "samples" has 2 instances of "s", they are not together.

IsParselTongue("You ssseldom sssspeak sso boldly, ssso messmerizingly.") ➞ true
