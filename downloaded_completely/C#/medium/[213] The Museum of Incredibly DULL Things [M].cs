####  The Museum of Incredibly DULL Things  ####

A museum wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Katya, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and removes the one with the lowest rating. Just as she finishes rating the exhibitions, she's called off to an important meeting. She asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after the lowest one is removed.
Create a function that takes an array of integers and removes the smallest value.


[Examples]

___
RemoveSmallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ) ➞ [2, 3, 4, 5]

RemoveSmallest([5, 3, 2, 1, 4]) ➞ [5, 3, 2, 4]

RemoveSmallest([2, 2, 1, 2, 1]) ➞ [2, 2, 2, 1]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Don't change the order of the left over items.
*) If you get an empty array, return an empty array: [] ➞ []
*) If there are multiple items with the same value, remove item with lower index (3rd example).
