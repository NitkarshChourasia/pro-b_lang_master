####  Filter Repeating Character Strings  ####

Create a function that keeps only strings with repeating identical characters (in other words, it has a set size of 1).


[Examples]

___
identicalFilter(["aaaaaa", "bc", "d", "eeee", "xyz"]) 
➞ ["aaaaaa", "d", "eeee"]

identicalFilter(["88", "999", "22", "545", "133"]) 
➞ ["88", "999", "22"]

identicalFilter(["xxxxo", "oxo", "xox", "ooxxoo", "oxo"]) 
➞ []
_____



[Notes]

___
*) A string with a single character is trivially counted as a string with repeating identical characters.
*) If there are no strings with repeating identical characters, return an empty array (see example #3).
