/*
####  String Flips  ####

Create a function that takes a string as the first argument, and a (string) specification as a second argument. If the specification is "word", return a string with each word reversed while maintaining their original order. If the specification is "sentence", reverse the order of the words in the string, while keeping the words intact.


[Examples]

___
str = "There's never enough time to do all the nothing you want"


flip("Hello", "word") ➞ "olleH"

flip("Hello", "sentence") ➞ "Hello"

flip(str, "word") ➞ "s'erehT reven hguone emit ot od lla eht gnihton uoy tnaw"

flip(str, "sentence") ➞ "want you nothing the all do to time enough never There's"
