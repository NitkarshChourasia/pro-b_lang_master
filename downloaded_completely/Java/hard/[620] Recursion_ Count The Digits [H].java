/*
####  Recursion: Count The Digits  ####

Create a function that will recursively count the number of digits of a number. Conversion of the number to a string is not allowed, thus, the approach is recursive.


[Examples]

___
digitsCount(4666) ➞ 4

digitsCount(544) ➞ 3

digitsCount(121317) ➞ 6

digitsCount(0) ➞ 1

digitsCount(12345) ➞ 5

digitsCount(1289396387328L) ➞ 13
