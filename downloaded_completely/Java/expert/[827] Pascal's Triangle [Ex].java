####  Pascal's Triangle  ####

The goal of this challenge is to return Pascal's triangle up to number 29. Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two upper corners.
___
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1

// There will always be the 1 in the first
// place and the row in the second.
_____


Create a function that returns a row from Pascal's triangle. To find the row and column you can use n!/(k!*(n-k)!) where n is the row down and k is the column.


[Examples]

___
pascalsTriangle(1) ➞ "1 1"

pascalsTriangle(4) ➞ "1 4 6 4 1"

pascalsTriangle(6) ➞ "1 6 15 20 15 6 1"

pascalsTriangle(8) ➞ "1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1"
