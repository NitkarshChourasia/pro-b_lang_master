####  Ascending Consecutive Numbers  ####

Write a function that returns true if a string consists of ascending or ascending AND consecutive numbers.


[Examples]

___
ascending("232425") ➞ true
// Consecutive numbers 23, 24, 25

ascending("2324256") ➞ false
// No matter how this string is divided, the numbers are not consecutive.

ascending("444445") ➞ true
// Consecutive numbers 444 and 445.
_____



[Notes]

A number can consist of any number of digits, so long as the numbers are adjacent to each other, and the string has at least two of them.
