####  Is the Word Singular or Plural?  ####

Create a function that takes in a word and determines whether or not it is plural. A plural word is one that ends in "s".


[Examples]

___
isPlural("changes") ➞ true

isPlural("change") ➞ false

isPlural("dudes") ➞ true

isPlural("magic") ➞ false
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Don't forget to return the result.
*) Remember that return true (boolean) is not the same as return "true" (string).
*) This is an oversimplification of the English language. We are ignoring edge cases like "goose" and "geese", "fungus" and "fungi", etc.
*) If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab.
